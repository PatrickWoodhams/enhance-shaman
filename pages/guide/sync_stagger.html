              In TBC, sync and stagger matter for two outcomes only:

              If your off hand leads at the wrong time, you can burn <span data-spell="flurry">Flurry</span> charges on off hand hits
              and you can lose value when <span data-spell="windfury_weapon">Windfury Weapon</span> is not favoring the main hand.
              This page explains what is happening, what bad timing looks like, and gives you a trainer so you can correct your swing relationship on demand.

                  Sync is about how close together your main hand and off hand swings land.

                <h3>What Flurry is</h3>
                <p>
                  <span data-spell="flurry"></span> is a talent that activates when you critically strike. When it is active,
                  your next three weapon swings gain a large attack speed bonus.
                  Flurry does not last forever. It is consumed by your swings.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="rule">
                <h3>How Flurry actually gets consumed</h3>
                <p>
                  <span data-spell="flurry"></span> has a short internal window of 0.5 seconds when it consumes charges.
                  If two weapon swings land close together, both swings can benefit
                  while only spending one <span data-spell="flurry"></span> charge.
                  If your swings land too far apart, each swing consumes its own charge.
                </p>

              <div class="rule">
                <h3>What sync means</h3>
                <p>
                  Your weapons are considered synced when your main hand and off hand swings
                  land within 0.5 seconds of each other.
                  It does not matter which hand hits first. The only requirement is that
                  the second hand follows within that 0.5 second window.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="rule">
                <h3>Why sync matters</h3>
                <p>
                  Sync keeps <span data-spell="flurry"></span> efficient.
                  When your swings are synced, two hits often share a single <span data-spell="flurry"></span> charge.
                  When your swings drift outside the window, you burn through charges faster
                  and <span data-spell="flurry"></span> uptime becomes unstable.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="rule">
                <h3>Perfect sync is not required</h3>
                <p>
                  You do not need both weapons to land at the exact same moment.
                  A perfect 0.0 second gap looks clean, but it is not the goal.
                  Staying inside the 0.5 second window is what matters.

                <p>
                  <span data-spell="windfury_weapon"></span> has a chance to proc on a successful melee hit,
                  granting extra attacks.

                <h3>What an internal cooldown is</h3>
                <p>
                  An internal cooldown is a hidden timer that starts when a proc occurs.
                  While that timer is running, the proc cannot happen again,
                  even if you land more valid hits.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3>Windfury’s internal cooldown</h3>
                <p>
                  In The Burning Crusade, <span data-spell="windfury_weapon"></span> uses a 3 second internal cooldown
                  that is shared between your main hand and off hand.
                  Once Windfury procs, neither weapon can proc again until the cooldown ends.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="rule">
                <h3>What stagger means</h3>
                <p>
                  Stagger means your swings are close together, but not perfectly aligned.
                  One hand consistently lands slightly before the other.
                  For Enhancement, you want your main hand to land first,
                  with the off hand following shortly after.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="rule">
                <h3>Why main hand lead matters</h3>
                <p>
                  When the Windfury cooldown ends, the first swing that lands has the best chance
                  to claim the next proc.
                  If your off hand lands first, it can take that opportunity,
                  leaving your main hand blocked by the cooldown.
                  By keeping your main hand slightly ahead,
                  you increase the chance that Windfury procs are awarded to your harder hitting weapon.

                <h3>Stagger versus being out of sync</h3>
                <p>
                  Stagger does not mean spreading your swings far apart.
                  You still want both hands to land within the 0.5 second sync window
                  for <span data-spell="flurry"></span> efficiency.
                  The goal is a small, consistent main hand lead,
                  not a large gap between swings.

            <h2>Weapon speed and drift</h2>
            <p class="muted">
              If you have a choice, use weapons with the same speed. Matching weapon speeds makes sync and stagger easier to set up
              and much easier to keep. Once you line them up, they stay lined up longer, which means fewer corrections and less lost
              off hand damage.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you cannot get same speed weapons, sync and stagger are still beneficial. You can still line your swings up,
              share <span data-spell="flurry"></span> charges, and favor main hand <span data-spell="windfury_weapon"></span>. The
              difference is that mismatched speeds will naturally drift apart over time. This means you will have to correct more often.
            </p>

            <div class="note noteWarn">
              More corrections mean more off hand delay. Occasional corrections are fine and worth it. Constant corrections are not.
              If you find yourself pressing the macro every few swings just to keep things lined up, stop fighting it and let your swings run.

    This macro is used to delay your off hand so the main hand can lead again.

  <p>
    Each press briefly stops and restarts auto attack. During that restart, your main hand
    continues normally, but your off hand is forced back to the midpoint of its swing
    if it has already passed that point. This creates a controlled delay on the off hand.
    If the off hand has not passed the midpoint yet, pressing the macro will not change your timing.

        If your main hand is already hitting first, but the off hand is not following in the correct window, wait until the off hand passes the halfway point of its swing. Once it has passed halfway, press the macro repeatedly. Each press holds the off hand back while the main hand continues forward. Keep pressing until the off hand snaps into the correct follow position behind the main hand. Stop pressing immediately once it lines up correctly and let your swings continue.

        When the main hand just passes the halfway point,

        This creates a small main hand lead.

    <strong>Important:</strong> While you are pressing this macro, your off hand is not dealing damage.

    you are trying to press at the correct moment. One clean correction is always better
    than repeatedly fighting your swing timers.

            <h2>Setting up sync and stagger before combat</h2>

            <p class="muted">
              The goal is to enter the pull already in the target state. Main hand hits first, and the off hand follows inside the 0.5 second window.
              Pre pull setup is not a separate mechanic. It is simply using the same resync timing you already use in combat, but doing it on the first swing cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can enable auto attack while you are still outside melee range. You will not swing until you step into range.
              Once you are in range, both swing bars begin moving. If you do nothing, they usually start very close together.
              A single, deliberate resync tap can create a small main hand lead before the first hits land.
            </p>

                    Target the boss and stand just outside melee range. Turn on auto attack before you step in.
                    This makes your first swing happen immediately when you connect, with no extra clicking on pull.

                    As you enter melee range, your swing timers begin. Do not press anything yet.
                    Let the bars move so you can see whether you are already in a good starting state.

                  <p class="stepBody">
                    On that first cycle, wait until your main hand just passes midpoint, then tap the resync macro one time.
                    This is the same timing your trainer teaches, and it uses the same mechanism described in your macro section.

                    After the first main hand hit, you want the off hand to follow shortly after and stay inside the 0.5 second window.
                    If it looks good, do nothing. The fastest way to lose value is to keep forcing delays when you do not need them.

            <p class="muted">
              Notes: if your weapons are different speeds, they will drift over time. Pre pull setup still helps, but do not turn it into a ritual.
